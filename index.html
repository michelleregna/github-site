			<p>Recently I decided to quit my job to focus on pursuing a masters in Information Systems. Previously, I worked at BuzzFeed as a writer and before that I was a digital imaging specialist at People Magazine. So as you can probably tell from my work experience and education, I don't have much experience in internet technologies. However, I have taken a couple front end web development courses. Overall, I'm looking forward to learning as much as I possibly can so that I can make a much needed career change. Right now I have hopes of becoming a software developer, but I imagine the MSIS program will open my eyes to other opportunities in the field as well.</p>
